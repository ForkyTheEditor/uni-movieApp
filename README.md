# University Homework Movie App

This small application was created as a university homework in late 2019 / early 2020. I was supposed to add a GUI to it as a later
homework (which I did! Well HOPEFULLY, still DOING it at the time of writing this...) but because of time constraints
it turned out PRETTY DAMN ugly and messy. As a result, I probably won't be uploading the update here, at least not in the 
same repository.

UPDATE (1 minute later): Have decided to upload the HORRIBLE code to a new branch (I didn't know it was that simple ok)

Thank you and may god help you if you actually open a movie store using this.
